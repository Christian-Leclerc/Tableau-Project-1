# Tableau_Project-1

## Purpose and Goals

This repository contains an analysis of the Wildlife Strike from the Federal Aviation Administration database (FAA) of the United States from 2000 to 2015.

The intent was to use my new skills using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software#reveal-hero) to conduct exploratory visuals analysis, create a dashboard and present a story answering a specific question. The focus of the analysis was to ***help airports and airliners pin point the scope of the problem*** for their specific location and help them identify the risks and the **cost** associated to it.

## Process

In the data folder, you will find the [cleaning_data.ipynb](/data/cleaning_data.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook that explain my process of cleaning and preparing the Excel file extracted from the FAA (given by the LightHouse Labs school).
With the cleaned file, I used Tableau to create several visuals while exploring the data trying to find relevant trends, outliers and any interesting insights.
I eventually identified a question I wanted to answer and created a Dashboard to help answering it and presenting it to the school students.

## Results
There was two options to choose from the school scope of work. The standard option where the questions were already pre-determined and the other option where we determine our own question and the way we want to create the dashboard. 
I chose the FAA Wildlife Strike from the second option list. It came with an Excel sheet with the data extracted from the FAA from 2000 to 2015 of all the reported wildlife strikes at each airport of the United States.

From the FAA website, a lot of insights are already known that explain the **increase in the number of reported strikes** such as:
+ Expanding wildlife populations
+ Increases in number of aircraft movements
+ Trend toward faster and quieter aircraft
+ Outreach to the aviation community

But, in my opinion, what airports and airliners wants to know to be able to do something is the **cost**. How much should I invest, why and where?
So all my visuals were "paired" with some kind of information with the cost, especially the cost of damage and the total out of service hours.

I divided my scope of work in 4 steps:
- **Trends**
- **When** the damage occurs
- **Effect** of the damage
- **Wildlife** associated to the damage
